## 现有IDS工具的缺点：

open source tools have different syntax of rules and signatures which cannot be used across different tools

IDS has distinct advantages and disadvantages such as the detection rate of the specific type of attack, false positive

## 本论文的检测目标为：

DoS and scan attack: DoS, port scan, network scan via UDP, network scan via TCP and network scan via ICMP.

> network attacks include DoS and scan attacks with maximum 35%

## 论文贡献：

- We use the deep learning technique to detect attack **without human-defined rules or signatures**.
- We use the deep learning technique to classify attacks **without accessing information in the packet payload** to avoid a breach of data privacy.
- We compare the detecting time between the deep learning model and Snort IDS.

## Snort IDS简要分析

工作机制：

- Snort software tasks and components are performed sequentially packet by packet. 

- With a huge amount of traffic, buffers will be full, and incoming packets may be dropped. (shortage)
- Has a long processing time since it will access not only packet headers but also user payloads before alerting or dropping malicious packets (shortage)

Snort repositories provide more than 20,000 rules obtained from the popular Sourcefire and Emerging Threats (E.T.) repositories. In this paper, we use emerging-dos.rules and emerging-scan.rules for Snort to detect DoS and Scan attack.

## 数据集：

MAWILab'2017 : 跟踪于日本到美国之间的跨太平洋链路

通过tcpdump命令以pcap格式捕获流量，并通过处理保护了源io地址以保护隐私。

大小限制在96字节，删除了数据包的有效负载

包含大量正常流量，并具有随机性

### 数据预处理

- 选择只包含DoS和Scan攻击流量各pcap文件
- 平衡攻击数据和正常数据数目以训练模型
- 将包数据准换为流数据（其区别在SiLK中介绍）（利用SiLK和Bro）
- 特征为流数据的数据，在SiLK和Bro'sConn.log中定义，包括IP地址，流持续时间，历史状态等16个feature
- convert data about IP address into decimal, and scale all data into [-1,1]

### 评价标准：

Precision, Recall, F1-sore, Accuracy, CPU usage time, processing time of the amount of the start time and end time.

#### SiLK tool ：

supports the efficient collection, storage, and analysis of network flow data

##### What is network flow data?

<https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/faq.html#pcap>

Network flow collection differs from direct packet capture, such as **tcpdump**, in that it builds a summary of communications between sources and destinations on a network. This summary covers all traffic matching seven particular keys that are relevant for addressing: the source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination ports, the protocol type, the type of service, and the interface on the router. We use five of these attributes to constitute the *flow label* in SiLK: the source and destination addresses, the source and destination ports, and the protocol. These attributes (sometimes called the 5-tuple), together with the start time of each network flow, distinguish network flows from each other.

A network flow often covers multiple packets, which are grouped together under a common flow label. A flow record thus provides the label and statistics on the packets that the network flow covers, including the number of packets covered by the flow, the total number of bytes, and the duration and timing of those packets. Because network flow is a summary of traffic, it does not contain packet payload data.

## Implementation

convert the packet to the flow and extract features

develop an intrusion detection system by using deep learning

comparing with Snort to evaluate the detection efficiency and performance for DoS and Scan attack.

using RNN, Staked RNN, CNN

## Experiment results and discussion

To validate the model, we used 10-fold cross validation with 60,000 samples in total: 54,000 samples for training and 6,000 samples for testing.

Use same datasets for Snort
